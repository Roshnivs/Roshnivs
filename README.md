👋 Hi, I’m @Roshnivs  

👀 I’m interested in tech, entrepreneurship, and making the world a better place—one algorithm at a time!  

🌱 I’m currently learning about AI, machine learning, and the art of turning ideas into action.  

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that merge technology with sustainability—let’s change the game together!
